# Customer-Info-App-Fastly
Description - This app will generate a Google Doc Spreadsheet with a report of your account usage over a period of time specified in the sidebar.

How to install/run? - You can make copies of this Google spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xAPnUSq8WnW4_936kjz6pJCsJQbtRRvsAJZTtakb2t0/edit?usp=sharing) and run the app by going to Add on -> Customer Info App Fastly -> Get started. This will throw up an app sidebar in the sheet that you can use to generate the report.

Various app features - a.) You can change the column title and any of the regular expressions starting row 23 in the Maintenance sheet and the app will search for that expression in your VCL b.) You can fetch all certificates your account uses in the Certificate tab c.) You can get details for specific services in the Data sheet d.) You can add additional columns to the data sheet by adding new ones to the bottom in the maintenance sheet or replacing existing ones d.) You can get region specvific traffic information e.) You can also add API end points from https://developer.fastly.com/reference/api/metrics-stats/historical-stats/ which will appear as new columns but you will need to add them before row 23 and update the VCL row info (where regular expression in VCL begin in our report) since that row shifts down by the whatever API endpoints you call

Caveats - a.) The tool is limited to run a maximum of 29 minutes so if you have too many Fastly services or fetch information over a longer period of time than default 90 days you may have to split your reports and run it multiple times b.) It won't run VCL regex info for C@E services c.) You will need an API key to Fastly and an account on Fastly to be able to generate reports
